Try using a TreeMap and a HashMap instead of MyHashMap.
Are the resulting word frequencies any different?
Ans: there is no frequency difference
Is the time performance any different? If so, how would you rank the three implementations (in increasing order of time complexity)?
Ans: In increasing order HashMap, myhashmap, and treeMap
How are % and Math.floorMod different? Which works more reliably for computing a hash table index?
Ans: Math.floorMod gives you the lowest number. However, % gives you just the remainer which makes them both reliabe.
What is the time complexity of MyHashMap.size(), and how could you make it much more efficient?
Ans: O(n) where n is the size of the table
How does this implementation compare to one where you would directly use your linked Node class from the earlier assignment? Answer briefly in terms of ease of implementation, correctness, reliability, and performance.
Ans: Performance in my hashmap is better whereas Linked Nodes are easier and they are the same in terms of correctness and reliability
